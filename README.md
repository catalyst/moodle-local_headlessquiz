# local_headlessquiz
The primary purpose of this plugin is to facilitate running quizzes on Moodle in 'headless' mode i.e. via webservice calls.

Previously, up to 6 webservice calls were required to just start a single quiz attempt, making this quite difficult. This plugin combines this functionality into a single call, streamlining the process.
